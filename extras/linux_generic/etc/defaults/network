# Network configuration

package network

# This settings define the network interfaces defined on a system.
#
# The configuration options defined here should follow standard 'network'
# package options available in OpenWrt. Not all options are supported, but
# those that are should behave identically to their OpenWrt counterpart.
#
# Note: Unlike other packages, the names of each interface ('loopback', 'lan',
#       and 'wan') are significant and should not be changed. Unum and related
#       components presume these sections exist and may fail or exhibit
#       undefined behavior if these sections do not exist.
#       The `ifname` option for each interface has no such restriction and can
#       be changed freely.


# The 'loopback' interface is used to configure the local loopback.
config interface 'loopback'
	option ifname  'lo'
	option proto   'static'
	option ipaddr  '127.0.0.1'
	option netmask '255.0.0.0'


# The 'lan' interface is used to configure the LAN network interface.
# This interface is always a bridge that is created automatically, if it
# does not already exist. Any other ethernet or wireless interface can be
# added to the bridge to easily make it a part of the LAN.
config interface 'lan'
	option ifname    'eth2'
	option device    'eth2'
	option type      'bridge'  # Always 'bridge'. See notes above.
	option proto     'static'  # Always 'static' for this interface
	option ipaddr    '192.168.15.1'
	option netmask   '255.255.255.0'
	option up        '0'


# The 'wan' interface is used to configure the WAN network interface.
config interface 'wan'
	option ifname 'eth1'
	option proto  'dhcp'  # May also be 'static' with the 'ipaddr' and
	                      # 'netmask' also defined.
	option up     '0'
