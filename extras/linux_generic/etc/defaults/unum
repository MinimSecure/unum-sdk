# Unum agent runtime configuration

package unum

# Options here customize the runtime behavior of the "extras" scripts.
# If Unum was built without CONFIG_EXTRAS

# Section names in this package are prefixed with the agent profile
# name, though this is not mandatory. Each section has a profile option
# specifying exactly which profile that section belongs to.

# Notes regarding unum integration:
# - The 'unum' UCI package maps the agent's notion of radio0 and radio1 (if
#   applicable) to a specific wifi-device section in the 'wireless' package.
# - All config sections for each unum.radio, wireless.wifi-device,
#   wireless.wifi-iface tuple must NOT be disabled in order to be setup when
#   the startup.sh utility script is ran.
# - By convention, Unum considers radio0 as 2.4GHz and radio1 as 5GHz.
#   Confusing the two may lead to unpredictable results on the Minim server-
#   side application, though any such behavior should be considered a bug.
# - Section names should not be assumed the profile as names are often auto-
#   generated. The 'profile' option in each section should be used to link
#   a section to a given profile.

# By convention, radio0 is a 802.11g/n (2.4GHz) radio

# as well.
