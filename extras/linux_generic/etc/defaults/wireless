# Wireless configuration

package wireless

# These settings configure hostapd and wpa_supplicant.
#
# The configuration options defined here should follow standard 'wireless'
# package options available in OpenWrt. Not all options are supported, but
# those that are should behave identically to their OpenWrt counterpart.
#
# Note: the startup scripts included with Unum use this file in addition
#       to sections defined in the 'unum' config package.
#
# Note: no passphrase is included in the default configuration. If the 'key'
#       option for a given wifi-iface is blank, one will be randomly generated
#       prior to startup.
