# Unum and Docker

The files in this folder are used to build and start a Docker container
complete with everything necessary to run as a Linux router, including the
Unum agent.

For the Unum agent to function, a Minim Labs developer account is required.
Sign up for an account or find out more on the [Minim Labs website][1].


### Known Limitations

 - Only supports USB wireless adapters on Linux
 - Does not support wireless adapters on macOS
 - Untested on Windows


## Building and Starting

Run the `docker_build.sh` script under `extras/linux_generic/` to build a
new image and then start a container and configure it for use.

On Linux, the script must be run as root or have access to the docker daemon.
From the unum root directory, assuming your host WAN interface is "ens33":
    sudo extras/docker/docker_build.sh ens33

Full usage:

```
extras/docker/docker_build.sh [-X|-B <builder>] <WAN ifname>
```

The WAN interface name (`<WAN ifname>` above) should be the host machine's
internet-connected interface. A bridge is created between the host and Unum
container and this is used as the WAN interface on the container.

Skip building an image at all by passing `-X`.

```bash
sudo extras/docker/docker_build.sh -X ens33
```

Skip building a builder image, but recreate and configure the Unum container:

```bash
sudo extras/docker/docker_build.sh \
        -B minimsecure/unum-builder:ubuntu-16.04 ens33
```


## Starting Unum

Once the container is running, you'll be placed into a bash session running in
the container. 

> You will need a specific, generated MAC address during first time setup. This
  MAC address is used to associate your agent with your Minim Labs account.
  Sign up and login to the [Minim Labs developer portal][1], click the top-
  right drop down, then click "Provisioning Details".

Start everything with `minim-config`:

```bash
minim-config
```

On the first run, the script will interactively configure Unum and set the
MAC address before starting hostapd, dnsmasq, and unum. Be sure to have the
generated MAC address from the [Minim Labs developer portal][1] handy!


## Technical Overview

There are two Docker images generated by the build, a "builder" and the actual
Unum-enabled Linux router image.

The "builder" image, built from `Dockerfile.build`, has all of the build-time
dependencies installed on an Ubuntu 16.04 base. When started, the container
will run the unum `build.sh` script and generate a tarball in
`/usr/local/unum/out/` (inside the container). This tarball is used in the
second stage of the process to install Unum.

The router image is built from `Dockerfile` and includes: dnsmasq, hostapd,
iptables, the Unum agent, and a host of other programs for running a Linux
router. Additionally, [several shell scripts from the linux_generic "extras"][3]
are included.

Other notes:

* Configuration files are stored in `/etc/opt/unum`
* Log files and other runtime files are stored in `/var/opt/unum`
* Unum and co are installed in `/opt/unum`

### CircleCI integration

The `unum` and `unum-builder` images are also built continuously and published
on Docker Hub using CircleCI. Check the [CircleCI integration notes][2] for 
more information on how this is done.
