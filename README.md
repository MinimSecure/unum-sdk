Unum SDK
========

This repository contains the open source distribution of [Minim][1]'s Unum agent 
and related, cumulatively known as the Unum SDK.

#### Status: early development

Currently, only the Unum agent source code is published and does not include 
a working build setup. We are actively working to include build instructions
for any recent Linux as well as OpenWrt. Additionally, each device running 
the Unum agent needs to be registered with a Developer account on the Minim
application; this functionality is yet to be developed.
