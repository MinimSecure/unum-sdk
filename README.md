## Getting started

The Unum agent is designed to operate on a network gateway device or wireless
access point. Once installed, link your device with the Minim cloud to begin
gaining insight into your network.

Download [a pre-built release for your platform][8] from the Releases page on
the Unum SDK GitHub.

Available platforms:

 - [OpenWrt][7]: build an installable package for routers running OpenWrt
 - [Linux][6]: build Unum for running directly on standard Linux distributions
 - [Docker][5]: run a Linux router with Unum in a Docker container


### Docker Quick-start

A simple way to try out Minim and the Unum agent is using [Docker][4].

Check [the `extras/docker` folder][5] for complete instructions.
