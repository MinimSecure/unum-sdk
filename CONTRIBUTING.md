Contributing Guidelines
=======================

This document describes in general terms how to contribute to the Unum SDK.


Get started
-----------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Unum SDK! We hope to make 
contributing as simple as possible-- don't worry too much about protocol
around [opening an issue][1] or [Pull Request (aka PR)][2].

There is only one absolute requirement: **Treat everyone with respect!**


### Reporting a vulnerability?

Contact us directly by [mail at labs@minim.co][6] to report security issues. 
Encode your message with the [Minim Labs public PGP key][8], if desired.


### Opening an Issue

Don't sweat it, just [open an issue on our GitHub][1]. 

If none of the templates fit, feel free to improvise!


### Opening a Pull Request

In general, follow these steps when opening a pull request:

1. [Fork the Unum SDK repository][3] on GitHub
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Check out a new branch -- name it anything!
4. Make your changes, commit, and push to your fork on GitHub
5. [Open a Pull Request][2] on the main Unum SDK GitHub repository

Every pull request must pass CI before being merged, and merges are performed
by rebase-and-squashing.


Helpful things to include
-------------------------

Whether you're opening an issue or a PR, it is helpful for us to know:

- Platform you're building the SDK on (if applicable)
- Platform you're running Unum on
- Version of the Unum SDK you're using


Other things to be aware of
---------------------------

- Unum SDK is licensed under [Apache 2.0][4] and should not contain any GPL-
  licensed code. Any contributions are expected to be original works unless
  otherwise explicitly noted and attributed.
- Unum SDK is based on an internal Minim project and should remain structurally
  and technically compatible-- we don't recommend drastic changes without 
  chatting with us first!
