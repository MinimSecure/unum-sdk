# Add feature list defines. Not all of them are important for the agent code.
# Here are some that are used (there are more, not all are listed here):
# FEATURE_LAN_ONLY - the platform is a standalone AP-only or managed device,
#                    unlike the AP mode for gateway devices this option turns on
#                    collecting devices telemetry for traffic crossing the LAN
#                    bridge (i.e. from wireless to Ethernet or other wireless
#                    interface). For managed devices the agent watches its
#                    own traffic only (i.e. to/from local interfaces)
# FEATURE_AP_MODE -  the platform supports operating in the AP mode (in this
#                    mode the agent is expected to run on a device operating as
#                    an AP or extender in a LAN alredy running managed gateway,
#                    when in this mode the agent does not collect telemetry
#                    duplicating that of the LAN gateway).
# FEATURE_MESH_11S - the platform supports IEEE 802.11s mesh and has to handle
#                    meash_11s_ap/meash_11s_gw operation modes, it might also
#                    do some extra work to collect info about the 802.11s mesh
#                    interfaces and STAs.
