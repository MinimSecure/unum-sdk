# Distribution-specific builds

Maintainer notes for building and publishing various "finished product"
produced by or with the Unum SDK.

- [OpenWrt (.ipk and full images)][2]
- [Debian, Ubuntu (.deb)][1]
- [Unum for Docker][3]


## OpenWrt images and .ipks

OpenWrt binaries are built inside Docker containers using the 
[MinimSecure/openwrt-builder][5] project.


## .deb for Debian-like

Prerequisites on Debian or Ubuntu:

* unum-sdk build dependencies (see [README.md-linux_generic][4])
* `debhelper`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install debhelper
  ```

Build an architecture-specific `.deb` for the current system's architecture
with the [make_dotdeb.sh script][6] in this directory.

From the SDK root directory, run the make_dotdeb.sh script:

```bash
sudo dist/make_dotdeb.sh
```

The newly built `.deb` will be in the `out/` directory relative to the Unum 
SDK root directory.


## Unum for Docker

Unum for Docker is [built on CircleCI][101] and published on Docker Hub under the
[minimsecure organization][7]. Both images produced bythe bundled Docker extras
are built and published:
- [minimsecure/unum][8]
- [minimsecure/unum-builder][9]

### Other Docker images

Unum SDK's [CircleCI configuration][101] also creates, publishes, and uses some 
lightly specialized containers:
- [minimsecure/circleci-debian-amd64][10]
- [minimsecure/circleci-debian-armhf][11]
